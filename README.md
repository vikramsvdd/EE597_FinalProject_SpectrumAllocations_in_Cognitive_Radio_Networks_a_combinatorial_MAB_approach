# EE597_FinalProject_SpectrumAllocations_in_Cognitive_Radio_Networks_a_combinatorial_MAB_approach
Hello Y'all!, welcome to our github repo on using Reinforcement Learning (specifically Combinatorial Multiarmed Bandits) for a typical Computer Networks problem statement.
The codes are all available here, with the report detailing the problem statement and our solution, be sure to check it out, it is a 4 page IEEE paper that is concise and hope it offers you the intuition! happy reading!
